# rabbitmq
RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker that enables different parts of a system to communicate and exchange information asynchronously. It implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and allows decoupling of application components so that they can scale independently and handle failure more gracefully.
